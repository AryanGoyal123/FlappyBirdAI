NeuroEcolution of Augmenting Topologies is an evolutionary algorithm thet creates Artifical neural networks. The population of individual 
genomes is maintained. Each genome has two sets of genes that build ANN. Node and connection genes. Fitness function in order to get a single value
of the quality of the genome. When the algorithm reaches a maximum value for the fitness function output, we terminate the algo.

We are basically evolving the neural network, randomly change values, remove/add connections, and add more nodes. This is a type of genetic algorithm. 

Inputs: Bird y, distance between the bird and the top/bottom of the pipe
Output: the change in the rotation and velocity of the bird, jump or not (what the program should do)
Activation Function: tanh, check if greater than 1.5
population size: 100 birds (how many in each generations), take the best and bread them so that they the next is better
fitness function:  the most important part becuase it shows how good the birds are doing, distance
max generations: 30


When the species goes extint they are removed from the mix of population. Nodes can be input/output and genomes are the connections. 
Mutate power and mutate rate is at what rate the genomes will change. We are have default values. The connections maybe active or not (dropout). 

The survival_threshold of the specifies.
